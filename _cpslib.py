Methods to interact with the Google Cloud Print Service APIs.

GCPService will provide methods to access all of Cloud Print's Interfaces:

delete (delete printer)
deletejob (delete print job)
jobs (get print jobs)
list (list printers belonging to a specific proxy)
printer (get printer capabilities and info)
register (register a printer)
search (search for printers and return basic information)
submit (submit a print job)

These interfaces are not used in the library, as they are printer specific:

control (used by printer to update job state)
fetch (used by printer to get the next print job)
update (used by printer to update printer attributes)
share (used by applications and interacts with GCP, not printers)
unshare (used by applications and only interacts with GCP, not printers)


This module is dependent on modules from the LogoCert pacakge.
